# Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of wine using simple neural networks. The analysis explores how varying hyperparameters—including the number of layers (depth) and the number of neurons per layer (breadth)—impacts model performance. All work is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Dataset

- **File:** `winequality-red.csv`
- **Description:** Contains physicochemical properties of red wine samples (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol) and their quality ratings (scores between 0 and 10).
- **Source:** This dataset is a common benchmark for regression and classification tasks in machine learning.

### Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science and deep learning libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow or keras

### Model Details

- The notebook explores simple feedforward neural networks for wine quality prediction.
- Experiments include varying:
  - **Depth:** Number of hidden layers
  - **Breadth:** Number of neurons per layer
  - Other hyperparameters (e.g., activation functions, optimizers, epochs) as relevant
- Results are visualized to compare the impact of different architectures and settings.
